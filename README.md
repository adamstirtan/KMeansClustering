# K-Means Clustering in C# with Flower Data

This repository contains the source code and article for understanding and implementing K-Means Clustering using C# with an example flower dataset from the [Microsoft Learn article on Clustering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/fundamentals-machine-learning/7-clustering). The article provides a step-by-step guide, and the code allows you to experiment with K-Means Clustering and data visualization in Google Colab.

## Introduction

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups data points based on their similarities. K-Means Clustering, a popular clustering algorithm, helps reveal patterns and relationships within datasets. This project guides you through K-Means Clustering in C# with a flower dataset, emphasizing data visualization using Google Colab.

## Development Environment

To set up your development environment for this project, follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/adamstirtan/KMeansClustering
cd KMeansClustering
dotnet run
```

## Implementation

The code for implementing K-Means Clustering in C# can be found in this repository. You can explore the step-by-step implementation, load the flower dataset, preprocess the data, and perform clustering. Feel free to customize and experiment with the code. Google Colab provides a user-friendly environment for data visualization. In the article, we explain how to use Google Colab to visualize the clusters created by K-Means Clustering. You can import the clustered data, create scatter plots, and interpret the results.
